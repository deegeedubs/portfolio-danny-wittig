## Overview of Site


## Summary

HTML was used to create heading, about me, project, and contact sections. Links were created in the heading to scroll to the other sections.

CSS was used to style the website, utilizing root variables to keep consistent color schemes. Flex boxes were used to assist with responsive design for varying screen dimensions. Hover elements were implemented on the project images to display the project name and add a shadow to highlight the project. Clicking these project images will link you to the respective GitHub repository.

HTML was used to create links to my email, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
